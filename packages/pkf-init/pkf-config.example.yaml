# PKF Configuration Example
# This file demonstrates how to configure PKF constants for your project.
# Copy this file to your project root and modify values as needed.
# Usage: pkf-init -c path/to/pkf-config.yaml

# Analysis stage configuration
analysis:
  # Maximum number of parallel document inspections
  # Higher values = faster but more API usage
  # Default: 3
  maxParallelInspections: 3

# Orchestration configuration
orchestration:
  # Maximum iterations for agent conversations
  # Higher values allow more complex negotiations but increase cost
  # Default: 5
  maxIterations: 5

# Planning configuration
planning:
  # Average output tokens per document for cost estimation
  # Adjust based on your typical document complexity
  # Default: 1000
  avgOutputTokensPerDoc: 1000

# API client configuration
api:
  # Maximum number of retry attempts for failed API calls
  # Set to 0 to disable retries
  # Default: 3
  maxRetries: 3

  # Base delay between retries in milliseconds
  # Uses exponential backoff (delay * 2^attempt)
  # Default: 1000
  retryDelayMs: 1000

  # API request timeout in milliseconds
  # Long-running operations (like schema design) may need 30+ minutes
  # Set to 0 to disable timeout entirely (not recommended)
  # Default: 1800000 (30 minutes)
  timeout: 1800000

# Environment Variable Overrides
# You can also override these values using environment variables:
# - PKF_MAX_PARALLEL_INSPECTIONS
# - PKF_MAX_ITERATIONS
# - PKF_AVG_OUTPUT_TOKENS_PER_DOC
# - PKF_MAX_RETRIES
# - PKF_RETRY_DELAY_MS
# - PKF_API_TIMEOUT
#
# Environment variables take precedence over file configuration.
